The App.net API is a JSON API.

Guiding principles are:

* Always return JSON. If you are using JSONP, the returned JSON will be wrapped in a function call.
* Utilize HTTP error codes and methods.
* In general, required parameters are in URLs; optional parameters are specified in the query string. **This is not always the case.**
* If we need complex data structures from you, you should send them as a JSON string. We don't need any more conventions for putting arrays and dictionaries directly into URL-encoded GET/POST values.
* We follow a convention of including the API version number in the resource path. API calls of version 0 are subject to change throughout the process. Once we promote something to version 1, we hope to keep its implementation stable.
