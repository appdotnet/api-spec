## Notes on data formats

### Dates

Dates will be formatted as a **strict** subset of [ISO 8601](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601). Dates are parseable by almost any ISO 8601 date parser or merely by parsing from position. All dates will be formatted as follows:

`2012-12-31T13:22:55Z`

where `2012` is the year, `12` represents December, `31` represents the 31st day of the month, `13` represents 1 PM, `22` minutes and `55` seconds past the hour. All times will be expressed in terms of UTC.

This format was chosen to minimize ambiguity and edge cases in terms of parsing while maximizing readability of dates during
development.

### Object IDs

Object ids will always be transferred as strings to avoid issues with with limitations of JavaScript integers. You can assume that object ids are integers.
